# React Transition

## Why?

I decided to create this package because often used `react-transition-group`
but I didn't like some things about it. For instance you have to pass `timeout`
or provide your custom `addEndListener`. Also you don't have a "move" transition
for `<TransitionGroup />`. More on the differences you can read in this section.
