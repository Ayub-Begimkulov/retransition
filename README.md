The library that helps you create smooth transitions in your react app.

| English | [Russian](README.ru-RU.md) |

## Features

- Automatic transition/animation end detection
- List animations with FLIP technique
- React strict mode compatible
- Small size (<2.8kb minified gzipped)
- TypeScript support out of the box

## Motivation

I decided to create this package because often used `react-transition-group`
but I didn't like some things about it. For instance, you have to pass `timeout`
or provide your custom `addEndListener`. Also, you don't have a "move" transition
for `<TransitionGroup />` and it's not strict mode compatible.

## Install

Right now this library is published as `@ayub-begimkulov/react-transition`. I used this name to publish the first version, but I'm still not sure how to name it (so if you how any ideas feel free to open an issue).

npm:

```bash
npm i @ayub-begimkulov/react-transition
```

or yarn:

```bash
yarn add @ayub-begimkulov/react-transition
```

Note that this library uses hooks, so you need to have `react` and `react-dom` 16.8.0 or higher.

## Getting started

### Basic example

[Try in codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/css-transiton-basic-example-928fh?file=/src/App.js)

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { Transition } from "@ayub-begimkulov/react-transition";

import "./index.css";

const App = () => {
  const [visible, setVisible] = useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setVisible(v => !v)}>Toggle</button>
      <Transition visible={visible} name="fade">
        <div style={{ height: 200, width: 200, background: "black" }}></div>
      </Transition>
    </>
  );
};
```

```css
.fade-leave-to,
.fade-enter-from {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateX(300px);
}

.fade-enter-active,
.fade-leave-active {
  transition: all 500ms ease;
}

.fade-leave-from,
.fade-enter-to {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: translateX(0);
}
```

Let's dive deeper into this example and understand what happens under the hood.

When you change the `visible` prop of the `<Transition>` component, it will show or hide the child element according to it. But it won't do it immediately. Entering and Leaving will be done in 3 steps:

1. At the step first element would be inserted into the DOM if it's enter transition. `fade-(enter|leave)-from` and `fade-(enter|leave)-active` classes would be added.
2. On the next frame (once the browser was able to rerender the screen and apply new styles) we remove `fade-(enter|leave)-from` class and add `fade-(enter|leave)-to` class. If classes are written correctly, this should trigger a transition.
3. Once the transition is finished, we remove `fade-(enter|leave)-active` and `fade-(enter|leave)-to` classes. The element would be removed from the DOM if it's a `leave` transition.

### CSS Animation

Although CSS transitions are more common and simpler, there are some situations where they don't give you enough control. That's why this library also supports CSS animations.

[Try in codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/css-animation-example-nroet?file=/src/App.js)

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { Transition } from "@ayub-begimkulov/react-transition";

import "./index.css";

const App = () => {
  const [visible, setVisible] = useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setVisible(v => !v)}>Toggle</button>
      <Transition visible={visible} name="fade-animation">
        <div style={{ height: 200, width: 200, background: "black" }}></div>
      </Transition>
    </>
  );
};
```

```css
.fade-animation-enter-active {
  animation: rotate-in 500ms ease;
}

.fade-animation-leave-active {
  animation: rotate-in 500ms ease reverse;
}

@keyframes rotate-in {
  0% {
    transform: scale(0) rotate(360deg);
  }
  70% {
    transform: scale(1.3) rotate(-108deg);
  }
  100% {
    transform: scale(1) rotate(0);
  }
}
```

### Transition type

Sometimes you may want to have `transition` and `animation` on the same element. This library will pick the one that has a longer duration to detect the end of the transition. But this may not be the case in some situations. For instance, if you have animation on initial render and transition on mouseover. In these cases, you have to manually pass about which type `<Transition>` component should care about.

```jsx
<Transition type="animation" {...props}>
  {/* ... */}
</Transition>
```

### Unmounting

Be default your child element/component will be unmounted on leave. But if you want it to be hidden with `display: none`, you could pass `umount` prop as `false`.

```jsx
<Transition name="fade" visible={visible} unmount={false}>
  <div>I'm always in the DOM</div>
</Transition>
```

### Transitions on Initial Render

By default, your transition won't run on the initial render. If you want to change it, pass `appear` prop.

```jsx
<Transition name="fade" visible={visible} appear>
  {/* ... */}
</Transition>
```

> Note that you could just pass `appear` without any value and it'd be equivalent to `appear={true}`

This will result in having enter transition on initial render. But if you want custom transition (different classes and events) for the initial render you could pass `customAppear`. In this case `${name}-appear-from`, `${name}-appear-active` and `${name}-appear-to` classes would be generated.

```jsx
<Transition name="fade" visible={visible} appear customAppear>
  {/* ... */}
</Transition>
```

### Custom classes

If you don't want your classes to be generated from the name, you could pass your classes through props. They'll override generated classes.

```jsx
<Transition
  name="fade"
  enterFromClass="class-1"
  enterActiveClass="class-2"
  enterToClass="class-3"
  leaveFromClass="class-4"
  leaveActiveClass="class-5"
  leaveToClass="class-6"
  appearFromClass="class-7"
  appearActiveClass="class-8"
  appearToClass="class-9"
>
  {/* ... */}
</Transition>
```

### JavaScript Events

`<Transition>` provides javascript events for each phase of a transition.

```jsx
<Transition
  name="fade"
  visible={visible}
  onBeforeEnter={onBeforeEnter}
  onEnter={onEnter}
  onAfterEnter={onAfterEnter}
  onBeforeLeave={onBeforeLeave}
  onLeave={onLeave}
  onAfterLeave={onAfterLeave}
  // only works with `customAppear`
  onBeforeAppear={onBeforeAppear}
  onAppear={onAppear}
  onAfterAppear={onAfterAppear}
>
  {/* ... */}
</Transition>
```

### List Transitions

<!-- TODO that it would only pass visible and appear -->

We've been working with single elements so far. But what if you want to animate enter/leave of list items?. That's where you should use `<TransitionGroup>`. It's like a state machine that detects an item addition/removal and passes correct props to `<Transition>` component.

[Try in codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/transition-group-list-no-move-8ww7h)

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { Transition, TransitionGroup } from "@ayub-begimkulov/react-transition";

import "./index.css";

const getRandomIndex = length => Math.floor(Math.random() * length);

const initialNumbers = new Array(10)
  .fill(null)
  .map((_, i) => ({ value: i, index: Math.random() }));

const App = () => {
  const [numbers, setNumbers] = useState(initialNumbers);

  const add = () => {
    const index = getRandomIndex(numbers.length);
    const newNum = {
      value: numbers.length,
      index: Math.random(),
    };
    const newValue = [
      ...numbers.slice(0, index),
      newNum,
      ...numbers.slice(index),
    ];
    setNumbers(newValue);
  };

  const remove = () => {
    const index = getRandomIndex(numbers.length);
    const newValue = numbers.filter((_, idx) => idx !== index);
    setNumbers(newValue);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={add} style={{ marginRight: 5 }}>
        Add
      </button>
      <button onClick={remove} style={{ marginRight: 5 }}>
        Remove
      </button>
      <div>
        <TransitionGroup name="fade">
          {numbers.map(n => (
            <Transition key={n.index}>
              <div style={{ padding: 5 }}>{n.value}</div>
            </Transition>
          ))}
        </TransitionGroup>
      </div>
    </>
  );
};
```

```css
.fade-leave-to,
.fade-enter-from {
  transform: translateX(200px);
  opacity: 0;
}

.fade-enter-active,
.fade-leave-active {
  transition: opacity 500ms ease, transform 500ms ease;
}

.fade-leave-active {
  /* 
    note that we add absolute position to leaving element
    so other elements change their position and trigger move transition 
  */
  position: absolute;
}

.fade-leave-from,
.fade-enter-to {
  transform: translateX(0);
  opacity: 1;
}
```

> Note that you can pass a `name` to your `<TransitionGroup>` and it will be used also for its children `<Transition>` components.

### List Move Transition

There is one problem with our previous example. When the item gets added/removed, other ones just snap into their new position. Let's see how we can fix it.

`<TransitionGroup>` adds `${name}-move` class to its children whenever they change their position. Let's tweak our previous example a little bit and see what we can do with it.

[Try in codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/transition-group-list-example-dkw6e?file=/src/App.js)

```diff
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { Transition, TransitionGroup } from "@ayub-begimkulov/react-transition";
+import { shuffle } from "lodash-es";

import "./index.css";

const getRandomIndex = length => Math.floor(Math.random() * length);

const initialNumbers = new Array(10)
  .fill(null)
  .map((_, i) => ({ value: i, index: Math.random() }));

const App = () => {
  const [numbers, setNumbers] = useState(initialNumbers);

  const add = () => {
    const index = getRandomIndex(numbers.length);
    const newNum = {
      value: numbers.length,
      index: Math.random(),
    };
    const newValue = [
      ...numbers.slice(0, index),
      newNum,
      ...numbers.slice(index),
    ];
    setNumbers(newValue);
  };

  const remove = () => {
    const index = getRandomIndex(numbers.length);
    const newValue = numbers.filter((_, idx) => idx !== index);
    setNumbers(newValue);
  };

+ const reorder = () => {
+   setNumbers(n => shuffle(n));
+ };

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={add} style={{ marginRight: 5 }}>
        Add
      </button>
      <button onClick={remove} style={{ marginRight: 5 }}>
        Remove
      </button>
+     <button onClick={reorder} style={{ marginRight: 5 }}>
+       Shuffle
+     </button>
      <div>
        <TransitionGroup name="fade">
          {numbers.map(n => (
            <Transition key={n.index}>
              <div style={{ padding: 5 }}>{n.value}</div>
            </Transition>
          ))}
        </TransitionGroup>
      </div>
    </>
  );
};
```

```diff
.fade-leave-to,
.fade-enter-from {
  transform: translateX(200px);
  opacity: 0;
}

.fade-enter-active,
.fade-leave-active {
  transition: opacity 500ms ease, transform 500ms ease;
}

.fade-leave-active {
  /*
    note that we add absolute position to leaving element
    so other elements change their position and trigger move transition
  */
  position: absolute;
}

.fade-leave-from,
.fade-enter-to {
  transform: translateX(0);
  opacity: 1;
}

+.fade-move {
+  transition: transform 500ms ease;
+}
```

### Custom move class

You could pass your move class if you don't want to use a generated one. Just pass a `moveClass` prop.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
<Transition moveClass="my-move-class">
  {/* ... */}
</Transition>
```

You can use "move" class to create cool animations. Check out this example:

[Try in codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/sudoku-example-86zxw?file=/src/App.js)

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { Transition, TransitionGroup } from "@ayub-begimkulov/react-transition";
import { shuffle } from "lodash-es";

import "./index.css";

const makeArr = () => {
  return Array(81)
    .fill(null)
    .map((_, index) => ({
      id: "$" + index,
      number: (index % 9) + 1,
    }));
};

const App = () => {
  const [numbers, setNumbers] = useState(() => makeArr());

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setNumbers(v => shuffle(v))}>shuffle</button>{" "}
      <div className="container">
        <TransitionGroup name="cell">
          {numbers.map(({ id, number }) => (
            <Transition key={id}>
              <div className="cell">{number}</div>
            </Transition>
          ))}
        </TransitionGroup>
      </div>
    </>
  );
};
```

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  width: 240px;
  margin-top: 10px;
}

.cell {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-around;
  align-items: center;
  width: 25px;
  height: 25px;
  border: 1px solid #aaa;
  margin-right: -1px;
  margin-bottom: -1px;
}

.cell:nth-child(3n) {
  margin-right: 0;
}

.cell:nth-child(27n) {
  margin-bottom: 0;
}

.cell-move {
  transition: transform 2s;
}
```

### Important note about move transition

When you use `<TransitionGroup>`, it assumes that you want to have a move transition. As a result, `moveClass` will be added to children, whenever they change their position. But if the styles for it don't have a transition, it won't get removed (unlike with the `<Transition>` component, which removes classes if the transition/animation is not defined). Because `<TransitionGroup>` doesn't check whether each child has transition or not, since it could be a performance bottleneck (for large lists). Therefore if you don't plan to have a move transition and don't want unnecessary classes on your elements - pass `moveTransition="none"`.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
<TransitionGroup moveTransition="none">
  {/* ... */}
</TransitionGroup>
```

### TransitionGroup

This is a container that wraps your `<Transition>` components and performs enter/leave transition on added/removed elements from the list.
